-- INNER JOIN can also be represented as "JOIN"
-- INNER Join = Fetches only matching records in both tables based on the JOIN condition.
-- Write a query to fetch the employee name and their corresponding department name.
SELECT e.emp_name, d.dept_name
FROM employee e
INNER JOIN department d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id;

-- LEFT JOIN can also be represented as "LEFT OUTER JOIN"
-- LEFT Join = INNER Join + all remaining records from Left Table (returns null value for any columns fetched from right table)
-- Write a query to fetch ALL the employee name and their corresponding department name.
SELECT e.emp_name, d.dept_name
FROM employee e
LEFT JOIN department d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id;

-- RIGHT JOIN can also be represented as "RIGHT OUTER JOIN"
-- RIGHT Join = INNER Join + all remaining records from Right Table (returns null value for any columns fetched from left table)
-- Write a query to fetch ALL the department and the employees under these departments.
SELECT e.emp_name, d.dept_name
FROM employee e
RIGHT JOIN department d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id;


-- FULL JOIN can also be represented as "FULL OUTER JOIN"
-- FULL Join = INNER Join
--              + all remaining records from Left Table (returns null value for any columns fetched from right table)
--              + all remaining records from Right Table (returns null value for any columns fetched from left table)

-- Make sure to include all the employees and the departments.
SELECT e.emp_name, d.dept_name

FULL JOIN department d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id;


-- CROSS JOIN --
-- CROSS JOIN returns cartesian product.
-- Meaning it will match every record from the left table with every record from the right table hence it will return records from both table.
-- No join condition is required to be specified.
SELECT e.emp_name, d.dept_name
FROM employee e
CROSS JOIN department d;

-- Write a query to fetch the employee name and their corresponding department name.
-- Also make sure to display the company name and the company location correspodning to each employee.


-- NATURAL JOIN - SQL will naturally choose the column on which join should happen based on the column name.
-- Natural join will perform inner join operation if there are columns with same name in both table. If there are more than 1 column with same name then join will happen based on all these columns.
-- If there are no columns with same name in both table then it performs cross join
-- If you specify * in select list then it displays the join columns in the beginning and does not repeat it.
-- No join condition is required to be specified.
SELECT *
FROM employee e

-- Altering the dept_id column name to see how Natural Join acts when there are no common column names in both tables.
--alter table department rename column dept_id to department_id
--alter table department rename column department_id to dept_id;



-- SELF JOIN - When you join a table to itself, this is called as SELF Join.
-- There is no keyword like SELF JOIN but we just use the regular JOIN keyword to make the self join.
-- Write a query to fetch the child name and their age correspodning to their parent name and parent age.
select child.name as child_name

-- ANSI JOIN - Uses the JOIN clause and mentions join condition under the ON clause and filter conditions in the WHERE clause.
SELECT e.emp_name, d.dept_name
FROM employee e
JOIN department d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id
WHERE e.salary > 15000;

SELECT e.emp_name, d.dept_name
FROM employee e
LEFT JOIN department d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id
WHERE e.salary > 15000;


-- Non ANSI JOIN - Uses comma to seperate multiple tables and then use WHERE clause to mention both the join and filter conditions.
SELECT e.emp_name, d.dept_name
FROM employee e
,    department d
WHERE e.salary > 15000
AND   e.dept_id = d.dept_id;
